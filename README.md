# Light Weight CircuitBreaker for REST Api's : 

This Project demonstrate Circuit Breaker pattern with the latest frameworks. Here I am using Spring Boot along with Resilience4j. Resilience4j is a lightweight, easy-to-use library that provides fault tolerance for Java applications. It is designed to work well with functional programming and is considered the successor to Hystrix.  Resilient microservices architecture is highly valued in modern software development practices.
